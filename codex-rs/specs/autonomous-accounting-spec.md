# Autonomous Accounting Agent Product Spec

## Vision
- Transform the Codex CLI and companion interfaces into a fully autonomous, agent-driven accounting platform.
- Blend a Xero-like web experience with Codex's advanced automation, yielding near hands-off bookkeeping with human approvals on demand.
- Harness ChatGPT-caliber reasoning for document understanding, decision justification, and natural-language guidance.

## Primary Users
- **CPA Firm Partners:** oversee client portfolios, configure automation policies, sign off on high-impact postings.
- **Senior Accountants:** review AI output, adjust mappings, manage exceptions, produce financial statements.
- **Staff Accountants / Bookkeepers:** upload client documentation, monitor status dashboards, resolve flagged anomalies.
- **Auditors (read-only):** view immutable trails, download working papers, inspect AI decisions.

## Target Companies
- Small to mid-sized business clients managed by CPA firms.
- Each company maintains a separate, tenant-scoped accounting workspace with its own policies and data segregation.

## Key Outcomes
- Reduce manual bookkeeping effort by >80% via autonomous classification, posting, and reconciliation.
- Deliver real-time financial visibility with trustworthy statements and drill-down explanations.
- Maintain compliance-grade audit trails to satisfy regulation and client oversight.
- Provide intuitive browser-based tooling that mirrors familiar accounting software while exposing AI insights.
