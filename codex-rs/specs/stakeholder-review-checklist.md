# Stakeholder Review Preparation

## Objective
Collect validation and decisions from product, compliance, and engineering stakeholders to confirm the autonomous accounting roadmap before deep implementation begins.

## Proposed Attendees
- Product lead / visionary
- CPA firm representative or subject-matter expert
- Compliance and security lead
- Engineering lead (backend + frontend)
- AI/ML lead for Codex agent behavior

## Pre-reading
- `specs/autonomous-accounting-spec.md`
- `specs/tasks.md`

## Decisions Needed
1. **Target Compliance Frameworks**
   - Confirm accounting standards (GAAP vs. IFRS vs. regional variants).
   - Identify required certifications (SOC2, ISO, others) and deadlines.
2. **Data Residency & Hosting**
   - Determine required regions, multi-tenant separation policies, retention rules.
3. **Autonomy Guardrails**
   - Define default approval thresholds and any mandatory human review categories.
   - Clarify exception handling expectations (who gets notified, SLAs).
4. **Integrations Scope**
   - Prioritize initial banking feeds, ERP exports/imports, and third-party services.
5. **Document Types & Volume**
   - Validate coverage of document formats at launch and expected throughput per firm.
6. **KPIs & Success Metrics**
   - Agree on automation accuracy targets, close cycle time goals, and reporting cadence.
7. **Pilot Program Parameters**
   - Select candidate CPA firms, timelines, success criteria, and support commitments.

## Open Questions for Stakeholders
- Are there regulatory jurisdictions that require unique handling (e.g., VAT, GST)?
- What are the contractually required audit trail retention periods?
- Do firms need dedicated environments or is logical tenancy sufficient?
- Which notifications/channels are mandatory for approvals and alerts?
- Are there existing tools/workflows the agent must integrate with on day one?

## Meeting Agenda (60 minutes)
1. Vision recap (5 min)
2. Walkthrough of product spec highlights (15 min)
3. Discuss key decisions (25 min)
4. Review open questions & capture action items (10 min)
5. Next steps & owners (5 min)

## Post-Review Actions
