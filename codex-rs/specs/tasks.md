# Autonomous Accounting Agent Roadmap

## Phase 0 – Foundations
- [ ] Confirm legal/compliance requirements for CPA firms (jurisdictions, retention, audit needs).
- [ ] Define hosting model, tenancy isolation approach, and security baseline (RBAC, encryption, audit logging).
- [ ] Finalize target tech stack for browser UI, services, data stores, and AI orchestration.
- [ ] Establish environments (dev, staging, pilot, production) and CICD pipelines.
- [ ] Build golden sample dataset and anonymized client artifacts for development/testing.

## Phase 1 – Core Platform Setup
- [ ] Implement company tenant model, user management, and role definitions.
- [ ] Stand up document storage with versioning, encryption, and metadata indexing.
- [ ] Implement document ingestion APIs + CLI/TUI commands (upload, status).
- [ ] Integrate OCR + classification pipeline (document type detection, key field extraction).
- [ ] Build initial ledger service (chart of accounts, journal engine, reporting data model).
- [ ] Wire Codex/ChatGPT agent harness for processing ingestion events and proposing postings.
- [ ] Create audit log service capturing document actions, AI decisions, and manual overrides.

## Phase 2 – Autonomous Posting MVP
- [ ] Develop policy engine for approvals (thresholds, account/vendor rules, confidence gating).
- [ ] Implement posting workflow: AI proposal → policy evaluation → queue for approval/post.
- [ ] Surface AI rationale and confidence scoring in data model.
- [ ] Build approval queue UI (list, filters, document preview, edit + approve/decline actions).
- [ ] Enable journal posting, reversing, and adjustment flows with immutable history.
- [ ] Create dashboard showing ingestion progress, automation coverage, and outstanding approvals.
- [ ] Expose chat assistant for clarifications and manual commands within UI/CLI/TUI.
- [ ] Validate automation accuracy on golden dataset; tune heuristics/prompting strategy.

## Phase 3 – Reconciliation & Close Support
- [ ] Implement bank/statement import flows (manual upload + parsing).
- [ ] Build auto-match engine (ledger vs. statement) with AI suggestions for unmatched items.
- [ ] Add reconciliation workspace UI with match actions, write-offs, and exception queue.
- [ ] Provide month-end close checklist tracking and status indicators.
- [ ] Generate core financial reports (Trial Balance, P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow) with real-time data.
- [ ] Add AI-generated commentary for management reports.
- [ ] Support period locking/unlocking with permission controls.

## Phase 4 – UX & Collaboration Enhancements
- [ ] Deliver Xero-like browser shell (navigation, multi-company switcher, notification center).
- [ ] Implement drag/drop upload center with progress, dedupe warnings, and chat prompts.
- [ ] Add inline chat dock with context-aware prompts and quick actions.
- [ ] Provide document-to-ledger traceability (click-through from reports to source docs).
- [ ] Build notification integrations (email, Slack, webhooks) for approvals and alerts.
- [ ] Introduce auditor view with read-only access, filtered reports, and export tools.

## Phase 5 – Reliability, Compliance, & Pilot
- [ ] Harden security (MFA, SSO options, rate limiting, DLP checks).
- [ ] Conduct performance tuning (ingestion throughput, reconciliation latency, chat responsiveness).
- [ ] Implement backup/restore and disaster recovery procedures.
- [ ] Complete SOC2-style controls documentation and logging verifications.
- [ ] Run pilot with select CPA firms; gather feedback and iterate on UX/policies.
- [ ] Document user guides, admin manuals, and support playbooks.

## Phase 6 – Post-Pilot Launch
- [ ] Address pilot findings, finalize pricing/licensing model, and update marketing collateral.
- [ ] Prepare production rollout checklist (data migration plan, go-live support rota).
- [ ] Launch production with phased onboarding of CPA firms.
- [ ] Establish ongoing monitoring dashboards and incident response procedures.
- [ ] Plan roadmap extensions (bank feeds automation, payroll, tax filing, mobile capture, integrations marketplace).
