# Multi-Company Accounting Platform Architecture

## Objectives
- Transform Codex into a modular, multi-tenant accounting platform with AI-assisted posting and human oversight.
- Preserve existing Rust workspace structure while introducing focused accounting crates and protocol extensions.
- Deliver a GUI experience that complements the CLI/TUI and supports drag-and-drop ingestion, review, and reconciliation workflows.
- Enforce rigorous validations aligned with IFRS/GAAP, multi-currency handling, and auditable change history.

## System Overview
The accounting platform layers new domain services on top of the existing Codex core orchestration:

1. **Codex Core** manages conversations, tool dispatch, approval flows, and protocol streaming.
2. **Accounting Domain Services** encapsulate ledger, chart of accounts (COA), tax, and compliance logic exposed through domain-specific tool handlers.
3. **Ingestion & AI Posting Pipeline** consumes documents and statements, classifies transactions, and generates posting proposals subject to validation and human review.
4. **Presentation Layer** spans the existing CLI/TUI plus a new web GUI built on the JSON-RPC app server and TypeScript SDK.
5. **Persistence & Observability** store multi-company ledgers, audit trails, and telemetry using existing tracing hooks augmented for accounting metrics.

## Open Questions & TODOs
- Finalize persistence choice (PostgreSQL vs. existing storage abstractions) and migration strategy.
- Determine AI model responsibilities vs. deterministic rule engines for tax and FX handling.
- Decide on GUI technology stack (React + Vite + Tailwind?) and deployment pipeline integration.
- Establish residency and data retention requirements per jurisdiction.
- Define strategy for extensible reporting (custom financial statements, KPIs).

# codex-ledger

Foundational accounting domain models and service contracts for the Codex multi-company ledger.

This crate defines:

- Core data structures such as `Company`, `Account`, `Journal`, and `JournalEntry` aligned with the
  design in `docs/accounting/architecture.md`.
- Enumerations and helper types for currencies, tax configuration, and tenant/RBAC context.
- The `LedgerService` trait describing the high-level operations (company creation, account
  management, posting, period control, FX revaluation, and audit queries) that downstream
  implementations will satisfy.

The crate currently contains type definitions, invariants, and unit tests only. Persistence,
integration, and protocol wiring will be added in future milestones.

**Summarizing present and missing features**

I'm putting together clear bullet lists that separate what the repo currently has from what the documentation and architecture say it should have. I'll reference specific files and doc lines to highlight existing domain models, invariants, and the defined trait while pointing out the lack of implementations, missing asynchronous design, and absent features like batch posting and advanced compliance. This way the user gets a concise snapshot of the repo's state compared to expectations.
[2025-10-15T05:36:53] codex

**Present Features**
- codex-ledger models core accounting entities (`Company`, `Account`, `Journal`, `JournalEntry`, `JournalLine`) with basic helper logic like `Account::allows_posting`, `Journal::can_post`, and `JournalEntry::validate` to enforce balance and currency provenance checks (`codex-rs/codex-ledger/src/lib.rs:25`, `codex-rs/codex-ledger/src/lib.rs:54`, `codex-rs/codex-ledger/src/lib.rs:85`, `codex-rs/codex-ledger/src/lib.rs:121`, `codex-rs/codex-ledger/src/lib.rs:177`).
- Error handling is centralized through `LedgerError`/`LedgerResult`, alongside request structs and enums that outline intended operations and state machines for entries, periods, posting modes, and RBAC roles (`codex-rs/codex-ledger/src/lib.rs:13`, `codex-rs/codex-ledger/src/lib.rs:145`, `codex-rs/codex-ledger/src/lib.rs:225`, `codex-rs/codex-ledger/src/lib.rs:265`).
- `LedgerService` trait captures the planned service surface for core ledger actions (company/account management, posting, reversal, period locks, FX revaluation, audit trail access), aligning with the documented API table (`codex-rs/codex-ledger/src/lib.rs:323`, `docs/accounting/architecture.md:60`).
- Unit tests cover key invariants such as double-entry balance, soft-close behavior, account posting restrictions, and FX provenance requirements (`codex-rs/codex-ledger/src/lib.rs:354`).
- README explicitly positions the crate as foundational types/invariants tied to the architecture roadmap (`codex-rs/codex-ledger/README.md:3`).

**Missing Capabilities**
- Trait is synchronous and lacks the `batch_post` API plus streaming semantics that the architecture calls out for high-volume ingestion (`codex-rs/codex-ledger/src/lib.rs:323`, `docs/accounting/architecture.md:65`, `docs/accounting/architecture.md:71`).
- No concrete service implementation, persistence layer, or COA template logicâ€”README flags that integration and protocol wiring are deferred, leaving the ledger functionality unusable today (`codex-rs/codex-ledger/README.md:14` vs. `docs/accounting/architecture.md:155`).
- Advanced ledger behaviors from the architectureâ€”dimension enforcement, period approvals, audit immutability workflows, realized/unrealized FX postings, tax auto-linesâ€”are not represented beyond simple data holders (`docs/accounting/architecture.md:31`, `docs/accounting/architecture.md:41`, `docs/accounting/architecture.md:46`, `docs/accounting/architecture.md:132`).
- RBAC, tenancy, and approval flows are sketched through `TenantContext`/`Role` enums but lack policy evaluation utilities or segregation-of-duties enforcement described in the multi-tenant plan (`codex-rs/codex-ledger/src/lib.rs:225`, `docs/accounting/architecture.md:95`).
- Surrounding ecosystem crates and tooling (`codex-accounting-api`, ingestion, compliance, permissions, GUI) remain uncreated, so the broader accounting workflows in the architecture doc are still conceptual (`docs/accounting/architecture.md:137`).
