Prompt:
Context: Read-only survey across codex-rs/app-server-protocol and sdk/typescript to plan ledger endpoints.

Agent: Review app-server-protocol JSON-RPC schema and TypeScript SDK patterns for new methods. Identify existing request/response type definitions, versioning approach, and TS SDK structure for RPC calls.

Files to consider: codex-rs/app-server-protocol, sdk/typescript

[Running in read-only mode - no modifications allowed]

Assistant Messages:
1. **Summary**
* Attempted to locate `codex-rs/app-server-protocol` within the repository, but no such directory or files are present, so the JSON-RPC schema could not be reviewed.

2. * Looked for `sdk/typescript` to inspect the SDK structure, but this path is also absent, preventing analysis of TypeScript RPC patterns.

3. **Testing**
* ⚠️ No tests were run (not applicable; required directories are missing).

4. I’m reviewing two directories but need to consult AGENTS.md for any instructions.

5. I'll find the AGENTS.md file.

6. I need to locate the AGENTS.md file to check for relevant instructions.

7. I need to check the directories now since there are no AGENTS.md files available.

8. I'm considering checking the path, just to be sure.

9. I'll try finding it using a deep search, maybe with `find`.

10. Hmm, maybe the instructions are inside the functions. I should check them out.

11. I might need to check the repo again or find the right file path.

12. Hmm, the repo might be missing. I’ll check for separate repo or deeper files.

13. I’m thinking maybe there’s a `codex-rs` directory, but I should check `ls Claude-project/functions`.

14. I’ll check for a codex-rs submodule; maybe it's missing from .gitmodules.

15. I'll pause here and hold off for a bit.

16. I’m wondering if the files might be zipped, or maybe in the root under `codex`.

17. It seems like codex-rs might be missing or zipped. I'll check for `.gitmodules`.

18. I’ll check the root directory, maybe it's a separate zip or repository after all.

19. Hmm, I thought the files might be zipped under `Claude-project/test-output`, but I don't see them. I'll try searching the repo at a deeper level with `find -maxdepth 2 -type d`.

20. Hmm, the directories seem missing. I wonder if the user expects them to exist. Should I just skip providing them, or should I fetch more info? Maybe they’re hidden due to git LFS... Running `git status` could help clarify.

21. Let me run `git status` to see the current state of the repo.

22. It looks like I might need to check if there's a zip file or submodule to fetch.

23. I might be in the wrong repo, or maybe submodules aren’t fetched. Let's try syncing.

24. The repo might be different, so I'll check for any remote with `git remote -v`.

25. I might need to check `CLAUDE.md` for guidance since there’s no remote.

26. I’ll check for a branch called ‘work,’ and see if files are missing.

27. I’ve already checked `Claude-project` for directories. Let’s see if remote fetching or decompression helps.

28. Checking if the directories are gitignored could explain some of the challenges I'm facing.

29. Hmm, could there be a branch or zip? Let me try `git ls-tree HEAD:codex-rs`.

30. It seems the directories aren't there, so I’ll check the `test-output` folder for a zipped file.

31. The directories seem unavailable; might search remotely or find them in a different branch.

32. Hmm, let me confirm if `codex-rs` is inside `test-output` instead.

33. I wonder if the directories aren't accessible, maybe because they're in a separate repo.

34. It seems like the instructions could be referencing a repo I don't have access to.

35. I can't find the directory or relevant repositories, but I can confirm that.

Directories are absent; referencing chunk `c779df†L1-L2` for not found. No modifications possible.

36. I couldn't find the requested directories. No tests were run either. Time to summarize!
