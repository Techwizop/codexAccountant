1. **Summary**
* Unable to inspect `codex-rs/app-server-protocol/src/protocol.rs` or the `sdk/typescript/src` tree because neither path exists in the provided repository checkout. Searches for `codex-rs` directories and `protocol.rs` files returned no results.

2. **Testing**
* ⚠️ `find . -type d -name 'codex-rs'` (no matching directories found).

3. * ⚠️ `find . -maxdepth 3 -type f -name 'protocol.rs'` (no matching files found).

4. I'll look for the AGENTS.md file to check for guidance.

5. I'll start by looking through the file `codex-rs/app-server-protocol/src/protocol.rs`.

6. I should check if the repository is organized into subdirectories. Let’s find that out.

7. I'm wondering if the repository isn't present or if it's a git submodule issue.

8. I think I might need to search for a different path. Let's try that.

9. The file path isn't showing up. I’ll check whether the repository is incomplete or zipped.

10. It seems like the repo path might be incorrect. I'll need to verify submodules and depth.

11. I’ll check if the repository is accessible by running `ls /workspace`. Let’s see!

12. The repo might be large, so I’ll check for zipped files in the 'codex-rs' folder.

13. I can't find the instructions. Maybe they're zipped in the `Claude-project/app` directory? Let's list functions.

14. I couldn't find the file, so I'll note that and reference my search efforts.
