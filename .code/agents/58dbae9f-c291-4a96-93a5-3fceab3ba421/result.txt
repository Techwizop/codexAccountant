Prompt:
Context: Implement tenant scoping for audit events in the in-memory LedgerService. Work in codex-rs/codex-ledger. Steps:
1. Add company_id: CompanyId to AuditEvent struct in src/lib.rs and update constructors/usages accordingly.
2. Update InMemoryLedgerService::record_audit_event in src/memory.rs to take company_id parameter and populate it.
3. Thread the correct company/tenant id into every record_audit_event call: post_entry (use posting company), reverse_entry (company from original entry), lock_period (tenant.tenant_id). Consider storing company_id alongside entries to avoid extra lookups.
4. Update list_audit_trail to filter events by filter.tenant.tenant_id before entity/cursor/limit handling.
5. Add a contract test ensuring tenant B cannot view tenant A’s audit events (e.g., after posting in company A, querying with tenant B yields empty).
6. Run cargo test -p codex-ledger and fix failures.


Agent: Scope audit events by tenant in codex-ledger. Add company_id field to AuditEvent, update record_audit_event to accept and store it, adjust post_entry/reverse_entry/lock_period call sites, filter list_audit_trail by tenant, and add multi-tenant audit visibility test. Ensure cargo test -p codex-ledger passes.

Files to consider: codex-rs/codex-ledger/src/lib.rs, codex-rs/codex-ledger/src/memory.rs, codex-rs/codex-ledger/tests/ledger_service_contract.rs

Assistant Messages:
1. **Summary**
* Unable to implement the requested tenant-scoped audit changes because the repository directory `codex-rs/codex-ledger` is absent from the provided workspace, so the necessary source files (e.g., `src/lib.rs`, `src/memory.rs`) are not available to edit.

**Testing**
* ⚠️ `cargo test -p codex-ledger` (not run; crate `codex-ledger` is missing from the workspace)

2. I need to locate the AGENTS.md file to check for any necessary instructions.

3. I need to find the AGENTS.md file to check the instructions.

4. I'll locate the path for codex-rs/codex-ledger since there’s no AGENTS file.

5. I'm checking if the repo is inside here, need to find it first.

6. I'll check if the repository is properly downloaded by reviewing the Git status.

7. I’ll check the repo status—maybe that’ll give me a clue if I need a submodule.

8. I think the submodule might not be fetched yet. I'll try running 'ls functions'.

9. I need to check if there's a remote submodule in codex-rs/codex-ledger—let's fetch it.

10. I’m considering checking outside the repo for something like codex-rs. Let’s see!

11. I should check if the repo is missing or if it's a submodule issue.

12. I’ll check if I'm at the repo root by looking for a cargo file.

13. I’ll need to use `find . -maxdepth 4 -name Cargo.toml` to locate the files.

14. Hmm, seems there's no Rust repo. Maybe I need to fetch or check remote?

15. No remote set up, maybe repo is minimal? I'll explore directories for rust or hidden files.

16. It seems like Codex-Ledger might be missing; I’ll search for 'LedgerService' to confirm.

17. It looks like I might need to create a new project or fetch from a remote repo, but no URL is provided. Maybe the repository is zipped or there's an existing dataset?

18. I wonder if the zip might be hidden in the commit history. Let's try `git log`.

19. This repo doesn't seem to be the one I need. Maybe I need another branch or remote? I could try creating the folder and files manually, but it sounds tricky without initial code and tests. Should I check for any zipped dataset or files like .tar in the repo?

20. I'm wondering if the path mis-specification is the issue; maybe I should check the remote branch.

21. Hmm, maybe the remote isn't set. I might need to clone or fetch from a public repo. I'll try cloning `https://github.com/codex-rs/codex-ledger.git`.

22. I'm considering creating a minimal crate or replicating features, but unsure about auth issues.

23. I'm taking a look at the .git directory to see what's going on.

24. I'll take a look at the config to see if anything needs adjusting.

25. It seems like without remote access and specs, we might need to create a new crate.

26. The repository might be private, or data could be hidden, potentially zipped in a subfolder.

27. I'm thinking of creating a minimal crate to meet the required modifications but without tests.

28. I'm considering creating a new crate, but I need more details about the ledger tests.

29. It looks like the codex-rs directory exists, but wasn't visible before. Let's try `ls -a`.

30. Hmm, the directory exists, but it's empty. Let me check for a .gitkeep file.

31. I might have to build a new crate based on instructions, though it's tricky without a base. Could fetch from remote but 404s. Maybe I should design a minimal crate that satisfies the expected features, though I don’t know full test details.

Since the directory is empty, I might create a minimal crate or fetch a `.tar.gz`.

32. I received HTML, possibly from GitLab's private login or a 404. I'll inspect a small portion.

33. Now that the file’s saved, I’m reviewing its contents. Let’s see what’s inside!

34. I'm considering creating a minimal new crate to match features based on the instructions.

I see possible functions in the given files, such as `record_audit_event` and `post_entry`.

35. I might need to consider creating a new crate to mimic existing functionality and tests.

I'll try implementing the crate and matching the expected `AuditEvent` and `LedgerService`.

36. It looks like the previous session ended, but the root session is still active.

37. The crate doesn't exist, but I'll try creating one to meet the test requirements.

I'll search for "codex-ledger" on crates.io to see if it exists.

38. Since we can't verify tests, I'll design a plausible ledger service crate with necessary components.

39. I'll parse the first few lines of the large JSON to find `codex-ledger`.

40. I’ll try creating a basic crate, matching the domain and functionality from the instructions.

I’ll search the entire tree for `CompanyId` to see if I missed it earlier.

41. I'll create a crate `codex-ledger` and structure it with `Cargo.toml` and source files.

I'll design types like `CompanyId` with possible `uuid` to fit the crate functionality.

I’ll summarize the issue, mentioning missing repo, no changes, and testing accordingly, but no commits.
