Cloud task completed: task_e_68eed3c514748326a47803da6b80e4e8

Prompt:
Context: Workspace root: /mnt/c/Users/sammu/CodexAccountant. Reuse existing codex-rs crates where possible. Read-only analysis.

Agent: Design a target architecture for transforming codex-rs into a multi-company accounting platform with GUI and AI-assisted posting pipeline, detailing component reuse and new modules/services required.

Desired output: Target architecture proposal with component reuse mapping.

Files to consider: codex-rs, sdk/typescript

[Running in read-only mode - no modifications allowed]

Assistant Messages:
1. **Summary**
* Produced a target architecture blueprint for evolving codex-rs into a multi-company accounting platform, outlining multi-tenant domain services, an AI-assisted posting pipeline, GUI/API layers, and operational capabilities, while noting that the current workspace snapshot lacks the codex-rs source tree and therefore the component reuse mapping is based on documented responsibilities that must be confirmed against the actual crates.

2. **Testing**
* ❌ _No tests were run; analysis-only task._

3. I need to locate the AGENTS.md file.

4. I need to find the AGENTS.md file to check instructions.

5. I'll list the files in the codex-rs and sdk/typescript directories to understand the architecture better.

6. I'll check if the repository is in a different path, maybe inside the codex.

7. I might be in the wrong repo. I'll check for codex or related directories.

8. I think the codex-rs might be elsewhere. Let's check the README for clues.

9. It seems the repository's intended path isn't present. I should inspect the root for any zipped files or potential submodules.

10. I'll look for functions to see if codex-rs is in a zipped form.

11. It seems I can't cite repo lines without accessing the relevant files or code.

12. This repo doesn't seem right. Maybe there's a submodule issue? Let's list files.

13. I'm unsure if the repo is the same; I may need to rely on docs or locate references.

14. I can’t access the codex-rs code, but I can cite the directory structure.

I can't access codex-rs directly, but I could reference a chunk showing its absence.

15. It seems like I can only make assumptions about structure without actual verification.

16. Looks like I can't access the repository directly. I'll outline a conceptual architecture instead.

Since the code's inaccessible, I'll outline architecture based on available knowledge, citing absence.

I can propose plausible modules like `codex-ledger`, but can't verify without access to code.

17. I'm considering how to respond given that we can't access the necessary code. Perhaps a high-level architectural plan could work without needing citations, but instructions demand them. I could reference the chunk `17d697` to show we're aware of the issues with modules like the `codex-rs` crate. I'll include the component reuse mapping, but I can't cite specific modules since they might not exist. This is tricky since I need to deliver a solid plan despite the limitations.

I’ll describe our inability to locate "codex-rs" and propose architecture based on assumptions. I'll split the plan into key sections like goals, current assets, and proposed architecture, structured with typical components, but I’ll clearly mention the assumptions since I can't verify the actual crates.

18. Given the limitations, I'll reference assumptions about codex-rs modules, noting that verification isn't possible.

19. I'll detail the architecture plan for the task but note it's conceptual due to no code access.

I'll provide a generic architecture and note assumptions due to missing code, citing as needed.

I'll summarize the architecture, flag assumptions, and cite when necessary to meet spec requirements.

I'll add a bullet referencing chunk `1d1692` to clarify assumptions in the architecture body.
