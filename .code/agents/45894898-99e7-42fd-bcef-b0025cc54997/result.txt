# Codex CLI (Rust Implementation)

We provide Codex CLI as a standalone, native executable to ensure a zero-dependency install.

## Installing Codex

Today, the easiest way to install Codex is via `npm`:

```shell
npm i -g @openai/codex
codex
```

You can also install via Homebrew (`brew install codex`) or download a platform-specific release directly from our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/openai/codex/releases).

## What's new in the Rust CLI

The Rust implementation is now the maintained Codex CLI and serves as the default experience. It includes a number of features that the legacy TypeScript CLI never supported.

# codex-core

This crate implements the business logic for Codex. It is designed to be used by the various Codex UIs written in Rust.

## Dependencies

Note that `codex-core` makes some assumptions about certain helper utilities being available in the environment. Currently, this

### macOS

Expects `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec` to be present.

### Linux

Expects the binary containing `codex-core` to run the equivalent of `codex sandbox linux` (legacy alias: `codex debug landlock`) when `arg0` is `codex-linux-sandbox`. See the `codex-arg0` crate for details.

### All Platforms

Expects the binary containing `codex-core` to simulate the virtual `apply_patch` CLI when `arg1` is `--codex-run-as-apply-patch`. See the `codex-arg0` crate for details.

# codex-app-server

`codex app-server` is the harness Codex uses to power rich interfaces such as the [Codex VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=openai.chatgpt). The message schema is currently unstable, but those who wish to build experimental UIs on top of Codex may find it valuable.

## Protocol

Similar to [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), `codex app-server` supports bidirectional communication, streaming JSONL over stdio. The protocol is JSON-RPC 2.0, though the `"jsonrpc":"2.0"` header is omitted.

## Message Schema

Currently, you can dump a TypeScript version of the schema using `codex generate-ts`. It is specific to the version of Codex you used to run `generate-ts`, so the two are guaranteed to be compatible.

```
codex generate-ts --out DIR

**Summarizing architecture and outlining phased roadmap**

I’m putting together a clear summary of the current Rust workspace architecture, referencing key crates and their roles, especially highlighting `codex-core`, `app-server`, TUI, and the TypeScript SDK. Then I’ll propose a detailed multi-phase transformation plan aligned with IFRS/GAAP compliance, data ingestion, ledger modules, AI posting, GUI upgrades, and thorough testing strategies—all while linking changes to existing components and emphasizing modularity and compliance.
[2025-10-14T22:41:04] codex

**Assessment**
- `codex-rs/Cargo.toml` defines a large Rust workspace split into crates for core logic, CLI entry points, TUI, protocol definitions, sandboxing, login flows, and integrations, giving clean seams for new domain-focused services.
- `codex-rs/core/src/lib.rs` exposes modular primitives for conversation/state management, command execution, sandbox policy, config loading, tool orchestration, MCP connectivity, and telemetry—an adaptable orchestration layer for AI-driven workflows.
- `codex-rs/app-server/README.md` and `codex-rs/protocol` describe a JSON-RPC (JSONL over stdio) bridge and shared type system, enabling external UIs/IDEs to drive the agent while keeping protocol contracts versioned and language-agnostic.
- `codex-rs/tui/Cargo.toml` shows a Ratatui-powered interactive shell with streaming updates, while `sdk/typescript/README.md` wraps the CLI for embedding in Node apps—useful foundations for future GUI and client integrations.
- Surrounding crates (e.g., `codex-login`, `codex-file-search`, `codex-ollama`, `codex-mcp-*`) demonstrate existing patterns for pluggable services, secure auth, and external tool adapters that can be repurposed for accounting data sources and compliance tooling.

**Roadmap**
- Phase 0 – Platform baseline & compliance framing: extend `codex-core` with an accounting domain context, define multi-entity tenancy metadata, and draft IFRS/GAAP control requirements (chart-of-accounts templates, posting rules, audit log schema) alongside updated protocol messages for accounting intents.
- Phase 1 – Data ingestion & normalization: build connectors (bank feeds, ERP exports, CSV/SaaS APIs) as new ingestion crates, using async pipelines plus validation/cleansing stages; emit normalized event streams through `codex-app-server`/protocol so both Rust services and the TypeScript SDK can subscribe.
- Phase 2 – Ledger services: introduce dedicated ledger crates (general, AP, AR, cash) with double-entry enforcement, period management, consolidation logic, and multi-currency handling; expose ledger ops via the existing JSON-RPC channel and add role-based access/auth layers.
- Phase 3 – AI posting pipeline: leverage `codex-core`’s execution/sandbox tooling to host AI classifiers and reasoning chains that map ingested events to ledger actions, incorporating human-in-the-loop review queues, confidence scoring, and reversible postings.
- Phase 4 – GUI & collaboration: evolve the app-server protocol to serve a rich web GUI (React or similar) backed by a new service edge; reuse streaming event semantics for real-time dashboards, approval workflows, and narrative insights, while keeping the TUI as an operations console.
- Ongoing testing & governance: institute compliance-focused test suites (golden IFRS/GAAP scenarios, reconciliation differentials, property-based ledger invariants), extend snapshot/insta patterns for UI states, add integration tests across ingestion→posting→reporting, and automate regression checks in CI/CD with documented audit trails.
