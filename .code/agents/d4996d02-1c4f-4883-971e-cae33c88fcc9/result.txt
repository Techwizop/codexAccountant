Cloud task completed: task_e_68eed0413e8083268da8d8d22e33e8eb

Prompt:
Context: Root workspace: /mnt/c/Users/sammu/CodexAccountant. Primary code in codex-rs (Rust Cargo workspace with CLI, TUI, core engine, protocol, app-server, backend integrations). TypeScript SDK lives in sdk/typescript, legacy codex-cli in codex-cli. Current goal is analysis only—no code changes. Focus on architecture-level understanding and transformation planning.

Agent: Research the CodexAccountant repository—especially the Rust workspace under codex-rs—to document the current architecture, key crates, and capabilities (CLI, TUI, app server, protocol, integrations). Summarize how the system currently works end-to-end, including model interaction, sandboxing, MCP support, and SDK tooling. Then propose a concrete high-level target architecture and phased implementation plan to evolve the system into a modular multi-company accounting platform featuring: double-entry ledger, chart of accounts, GL/AP/AR flows, multi-currency, tax handling, audit logs, role-based permissions, imports/exports, drag-and-drop document ingestion feeding an AI-assisted posting pipeline with IFRS/GAAP validation and human-in-the-loop review, plus a GUI on top of the existing UI stack. Highlight opportunities to reuse or extend existing components and identify new services/crates needed.

Desired output: Repository architecture overview plus transformation proposal and phased delivery roadmap.

Files to consider: codex-rs, sdk/typescript, codex-cli, docs

Assistant Messages:
1. **Summary**
* Unable to locate the expected `codex-rs` Rust workspace or any CodexAccountant-specific crates within the provided repository, so an architecture analysis could not be produced.

2. * Repository search for “CodexAccountant” returned no matches, further indicating the requested codebase is not present in this checkout.

3. **Testing**
* ⚠️ No tests were run because the expected project files were not available for analysis.

4. I need to find the AGENTS.md file for guidance.

5. I'm searching for the AGENTS.md to check any specific instructions for the task.

6. I need to check the repo architecture and plan the transformation before finalizing the message.

7. I think the repository might be under a different path. Let me investigate further.

8. I’m wondering if the Node project is zipped or if the repo structure differs. I'll search for context.

9. Hmm, no codex in sight. Maybe the repo is elsewhere? I'll check the README or docs.

10. It looks like I'm in the wrong repo; I'll check if it's zipped or at the root.

11. It seems like I can't find codex-rs. Let's consider noting its absence.

12. I think there might be so issues with the path or missing repo files. Let's investigate.

13. It seems this repo might not be the right one—I'll check the directories for Rust files.

14. Something feels off with the repo. Maybe it's just a large zipped file?

15. The repo lacks the requested components like codex, so I’ll explain the discrepancy and provide a plan.

Since codex-rs is missing, I’ll explain the absence and propose a general plan.

I can’t produce a plan with actual data, so I’ll inform the user of this.
